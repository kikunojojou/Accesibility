### Cognition

As humans we believe we have mastery over our mind, and we believe it will bend to our will. This belief isn't true. Our minds are picky. They warp memories to match their prejudicial beliefs. They are only able to intake and retain a few bits of information at a time. They are only able to focus on one thing at a time. That is why studying cognition is so valuable. It gives us the ability to avoid or mute the obstacles our minds have. When we make user interfaces, studying cognition allows us to make the interface readable, efficient, and stress-free. <br/>

Our minds are prejudicial. They fill in gaps of knowledge with past experiences to meet personal biased perceptions. If a button with a specific action is generally in a specific area, we believe it is there without confirmation. When a button has a different function and is placed in the specific area, most would repeatedly click the button despite its different function because the mind believes it will always be there. The mind does learn though, and learning to teach the mind by studying cognition is important. It teaches us to teach, so prejudicial mindsets don't cloud our irrational judgments. <br/>

Our minds cannot retain many pieces of information at a time. A general rule of thumb was our short-term memory can hold 7 pieces of information at a time. In reality, the number is lower. User interfaces should abide by this limitation. The interface should not have information that requires memorization, and it shouldn't have unnecessary information. There is a workaround with this problem. If the context has previously been established, information is easier to retain. Studying cognition helps us understand how to memorize, as well as weed out the unnecessary information that clouds our thoughts. <br/>

Our minds are only able to focus on one thing at a time. Our peripheral vision represents more than ninety-five percent of what we see. Our minds cannot perceive certain changes within our peripheral vision. If a error message displays without your peripheral vision able to pick it up, it will go unnoticed for a long time. Studying cognition allows us to figure what our peripheral vision can perceive, and our user interfaces need to use the knowledge to extend our field a view. <br/>

Our minds are flawed. We are limited in how we think, gather, and can perceive. Studying cognition is important to mute these flaws. If we don't study cognition, we don't know the audience, and a user interface fails without the user. <br/><br/>

### Working with Accessibility

Accessibility is prominent in working in the computer science field. We create for the user, so we must work to make it easier for them. This makes our jobs clearer because flaws would be easier to perceive and adjust to. This allows smooth progression, and our motivation is always to move forward <br/><br/>
